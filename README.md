MRI Brain Tumor Detection System 🧠
📌 Project Overview

• This project detects brain tumors from MRI images
• It uses Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning
• The system helps in early detection of brain tumors
• It classifies MRI images as Tumor or No Tumor

🎯 Objectives

• To analyze MRI brain images
• To detect the presence of a brain tumor
• To reduce manual diagnosis effort
• To support doctors with AI-based assistance

🧠 Technology Used

• Python – main programming language
• Deep Learning (CNN) – for image classification
• TensorFlow / Keras – model building and training
• OpenCV – image processing
• NumPy – numerical operations
• Matplotlib – visualization

📂 Dataset

• MRI brain scan images
• Two classes:
• Tumor
• No Tumor
• Images are resized and normalized before training

⚙️ How the System Works

• MRI image is given as input
• Image is preprocessed (resize, normalize)
• CNN model extracts features
• Model predicts:
• Tumor
• No Tumor
• Output is displayed to the user

🧪 Model Details

• Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
• Multiple convolution and pooling layers
• Fully connected layers for classification
• Binary classification output

▶️ How to Run the Project

• Clone the repository
• Install required libraries
• Run the main Python file-streamlit run app.py
• Upload or test MRI images
• View prediction result

📦 Installation

Install required packages using:

pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib

📊 Results

• The model provides accurate tumor detection
• Helps in fast and reliable diagnosis
• Performance depends on dataset quality

🚀 Future Enhancements

• Multi-class tumor classification
• Improve accuracy with larger dataset
• Add web or mobile interface
• Real-time MRI scan analysis
